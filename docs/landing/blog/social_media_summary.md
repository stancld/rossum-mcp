## Elevator Pitch (1-2 sentences)

Your AI agent works in demos. Then a user asks something slightly different and it hallucinates, loops forever, or burns $50 in tokens. 500+ commits building an agent taught me what actually makes them reliable.

## Short Version (Twitter/X)

Your AI agent works in demos.

Then someone asks a different question and it hallucinates, loops forever, or burns $50 in tokens.

I've been there. 500+ commits later, here's what I learned about making agents reliable:

## LinkedIn/Longer Format

Your AI agent works in demos.

It calls APIs, follows instructions, impresses stakeholders.

Then a user asks something slightly different.

It hallucinates. Loops forever. Burns through your token budget.

I've been there. 500+ commits building an agent from Friday hack to production.

Here's what I learned:

1. One abstraction cut 2,000 lines of boilerplate from my tool definitions
2. High-level frameworks look nice until you hit their walls
3. Nobody opens a separate app to use your agent
4. Sub-agents aren't for specialization. They're garbage collection for context.
5. Your prompt is too long. Smarter models need less hand-holding.
6. Loading all tools at once is like giving someone a 500-page manual
7. If you can't measure a prompt change, don't ship it
8. Let specialized models do what they're trained for

Most "best practices" I read online made my agent worse. The real fixes came from watching it fail.

Building with tool calling, MCP, or multi-model orchestration? Full breakdown in the blog.

- "Your AI agent works in demos. Then someone asks a different question and..."
- "Sub-agents aren't for specialization. They're garbage collection for your context window."
- "Nobody opens a separate app to use your agent. They just stop using it."
- "If you can't measure a prompt change, don't ship it."
- "The gap between 'works in a demo' and 'works for real users' isn't closed by better models. It's closed by subtraction."
